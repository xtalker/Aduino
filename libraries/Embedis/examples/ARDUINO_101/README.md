## Examples for Arduino101

Initial support for the Arduino101 platform.

Notes: 
 1) Tested good on 9/26/2016 with configuration:  
    IntelCurieBoard (Arduino101) Version 1.0.7 on Arduino Version 1.6.9  
    "set" (EEPROM Write) takes a LONG TIME to return - like 20-30 secs  
    so there is still something funky with "CurieEEPROM" we think...
