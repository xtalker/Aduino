# Embedis - Embedded Dictionary Server

## Examples for Different Boards

The Arduino IDE now has he capability to support many different CPU architectures and boards.
The generic Embedis example uses the builtin EEPROM however many other add ons are possible..

If you have a different board (and/or CPU architecture) you will need to use one of the examples specifically for that architecture or board.
